;;; Commentary:

;; As a part of re-learning Emacs after a break in the "square" world,
;; I find myself having a great amount of diffiulty spewing code all
;; over the place as my .emacs.d/ was in the past. So, since imitation
;; is the first step of understanding, I took Phil Hagelberg's
;; better-defaults package
;; (https://github.com/technomancy/better-defaults) as an example of
;; how to build a pretty emacs package.
